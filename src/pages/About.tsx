        The <strong>College Essentials</strong> Initiative aims to offer affordable mattresses, pillows, and essential toiletries to freshers joining college
        We are a team of IITians from different departments who saw how expensive and inconvenient it was for freshers to get started on campus.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        We reach the wholesalers,  streamline deliveries, and offer them at student-friendly prices without involving any middle man. This is a student-run, student-first initiative â€” <strong>by students, for students</strong>.
